# structured_communication

This mod adds trustless item trading between players.

Usage: Right-click on another player to open the trading form, then both
players can move items to the top ("offer") inventory line until both
players accept the trade.

This mod currently requires the player right-click handler patch by
sorcerykid to be added to server:
